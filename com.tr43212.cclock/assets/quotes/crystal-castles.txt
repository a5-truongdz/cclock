# Lyrics from Genius
# With repeating lines and parenthetical removed.

# Album: Crystal Castles

# Crimewave
Eyes lit on sharp threats from dark lips
The lights press the soft skin to rough hands

# Knights
Is this the HIV?
Angels die with you

# Magic Spells
Don't worry, dear Pamela
I'll do my scientific best to command your fleet

# Untrust Us
La cocaína no es buena para su salud
La cocaína is not good for you

# Tell Me What To Swallow
Through the wall, he threw me
I know he'd never hurt me
Daddy watch me sleeping
I've been praying for you, silently
Daddy's love makes me whole
Without him, I'm insecure
The only girl he'd ever love
Is one that smells so pure

# Vanished
In the dark—come out and play
We are its child—here to stay
Running through, hungry for stray'
No invitat—ke me away
I'm not cruel—still what you see
Club to club—city with me
Hungry for life—nt your pity
I don't want—t you give it
Still can't say she won't start up
Still can't say she won't start up a fight
You go city, 'cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait
In the dark—killer await—
To kill a life—life you make
You do another—death can live
Just keep on dan—movie you're in
Smell of your sweat—lures me in
Your heart—things to me
Running feet—through my blood
My ghost inside you soon will be
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat—your pity
I don't want sex, but you give it t—
Now it's over, you've taken your life
Dark grows thin and—left to hide
I don't regret it, but it's sad anyway
Now we're both dead and so scared of the black
This life of games and diligent trust
It's the things we do and the things we must
I'm now tired of being cussed
So go sleep forever end to dust

# Album: Crystal Castles (II)

# Celestica
As we fall into sequence
And we're eating our young
Remain silent and still for modesty
When the splints have been broken
And they can't help you now
Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally?
Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care
If I'm lost please don't find me
If I drown let me sink
We descended from no one
With a wink
When it's cold outside hold me, don't hold me
When I choose to rest my eyes coax me, don't coax me
Have they cleansed you with chloride?
And scrubbed behind the knees?
Has your body been hollowed by the breeze?
When I choose to rest my eyes

# Suffocation
We ignore refused consent
Animals do not repent
Courtesy to intervene
Weathered down my selfish needs
I suffocate
And promise me you won't resuscitate
And if I change my mind it's far too late
I'm wasting my days as I've wasted my nights and I've wasted my youth
You're waiting for something
You've waited in vain because there's nothing for you
Suffocation
Humility yet to be seen
Models made of plasticine
Morality disgrace us now
Entertain and take a bow

# Album: (III)

# Kerosene
Light of God dimming weak
Nothing's wrong, go back to sleep
Lost the will at an infancy
Drown them in charity
Lend them comfort for sorrow
Enthusiasm they borrow
I can clean impurity
Wash away with kerosene
Can't offend my modesty
Thank you for defiling me
Language pure as binary
Instruct with dishonesty
In nature, there's no tragedy
Bandage them in tapestry
Trade comfort for identity
Drown me in kerosene
I'll protect you from
All the things I've seen
And I'll clean your wounds
Rinse them with saline

# Transgender
The chosen few out of the youth
I'll lie with you out in the dew
Will you ever preserve? Will you ever exhume?
Will you watch the petals shed from the flowers in bloom?
Nothing can live up to promise
Nothing can stop its narrative
Nothing in place of catalysts
And you'll never be pure again

# Violent Youth
Show up in your lace
Drink up little girl
And they will always let you down
Hold your mother's pearl
Up to your cheekbones
Prevention is the only cure
Kiss them through windows
Throw up in your plate
Look angelical
If you sleep before I arrive
I'll pray for you, my girl
A flower on fire

# Album: Amnesty (I)

# Char
I'm afraid they're gonna find you
And there's nothing that I can do
A century of your priceless time
To commit a victimless crime
Vow to caress your rashes
Vow to punish with lashes
You can hide inside my locket
Put a leash on when they walk you
Next year say you didn't want to
Do they chastise you when you stray
Sallow skin and they can't look away
Start a collection of brine
Because all you do is cry
Wood ticks whisper to console you
All you do is cry

# Vinyl-exclusive
# Kept
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
